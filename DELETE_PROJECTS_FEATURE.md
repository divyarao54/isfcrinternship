# Delete Projects Feature

## Overview
This feature adds the ability to delete projects from the Project Repository. Users can now remove projects that are no longer relevant or were added by mistake.

## Features Added

### 1. Delete Button
- Each project card now displays a delete button (üóëÔ∏è Delete)
- The button is positioned in the project meta section alongside the creation date
- Styled with a red background to indicate destructive action

### 2. Delete Confirmation Modal
- A confirmation modal appears when the delete button is clicked
- Shows project details (name, teacher, year, description, students)
- Requires two-step confirmation to prevent accidental deletions
- Displays a warning that the action cannot be undone

### 3. Backend Integration
- Uses the existing DELETE endpoint: `DELETE /api/yearly-projects/<project_id>`
- Projects are permanently removed from the MongoDB database
- The projects list automatically refreshes after successful deletion

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components
- **ProjectDeleteModal.js**: New component for delete confirmation
- **ProjectRepository.js**: Updated to include delete functionality
- **ProjectRepository.css**: Added styles for delete button and modal

### Backend Changes
- Modified the GET endpoint to include project IDs (required for deletion)
- ObjectId conversion to string for JSON serialization

### State Management
- Added state variables for delete modal visibility
- Added state for tracking which project is being deleted
- Added loading state during deletion process

## User Experience

### Delete Flow
1. User clicks the delete button on a project card
2. Confirmation modal appears with project details
3. User must click "Delete Project" to proceed
4. Second confirmation appears with "Yes, Delete Permanently" button
5. User confirms final deletion
6. Project is removed from database and UI refreshes

### Safety Features
- Two-step confirmation prevents accidental deletions
- Clear warning about permanent removal
- Loading states prevent multiple deletion attempts
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

## CSS Styling

### Delete Button
- Red background (#f44336) with hover effects
- Small size to fit within project meta section
- Trash icon emoji for visual clarity

### Delete Modal
- Centered overlay with semi-transparent background
- Clean white modal with rounded corners
- Color-coded buttons (red for delete, gray for cancel)
- Responsive design for mobile devices

## Database Impact
- Projects are permanently deleted using MongoDB's `delete_one()` operation
- No soft delete or archive functionality
- Deletion is immediate and irreversible

## Error Handling
- Network errors are caught and displayed to user
- Failed deletions show error messages
- UI remains in consistent state even if deletion fails

## Future Enhancements
- Bulk delete functionality for multiple projects
- Project archiving instead of permanent deletion
- Deletion history/audit trail
- Admin-only deletion permissions
